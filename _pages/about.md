I'm a computer scientist and electrical engineer with a passion for Machine Learning in the wild. Whether it's on robots or in a hospital, I want to leverage data to the benefit the common man and the preservation nature.  

Outside of these interests, I play soccer, trail run, backpack, and orienteer.

Welcome to my website!
