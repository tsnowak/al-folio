I'm a computer scientist and electrical engineer with a passion for Machine Learning in the wild. I believe in pursuing ways to leverage real-world data to benefit the common man and preserve the environment. Whether it's by developing conservationist autonomous, underwater robots, building a reliable and valuable everyday, data-driven tool, or by finding life-saving trends in patient data, Machine Learning belongs in the wild.  

Outside of these lofty pursuits, I play soccer, trail run, backpack, and orienteer.

Recently, I have worked in [Jason Corso's](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/) computer vision lab as a Graduate Student Research Assistant (GSRA), and as a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) co-teaching the Graduate Robotics Systems course ([ROB-550](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/courses/robotics-courses/)) with [Ella Atkins](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/ella-atkins/), [Peter Gaskell](https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/peter-gaskell/), and [Shai Revzen](http://www.birds.eecs.umich.edu/). Prior, I worked as a Lab Engineer in [Jason Corso's](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/) lab.
